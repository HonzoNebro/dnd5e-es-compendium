I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp; Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.&nbsp; Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

At first glance a baboon may appear an easy target for unwary adventurers as they are only three to four feet in length, weighing up to forty pounds per recent recordings.

Hidden within their dog-like muzzles are deadly sharp canines and behind their eyes is a shockingly intelligent mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth Troop.</strong> Baboons are at their strongest when surrounded by their troop where they employ simplistic pack tactics to take down their foes. The monkeys have been observed skulking through tall grasses to set an ambush for unsuspecting prey or banding together to single out and mercilessly maul specific targets before moving to the next. Troops are governed by a single alpha who acts as the primary guardian of their fellows. Beneath the alpha, the troop works collaboratively, sharing food and resources between each other and engaging in communal grooming sessions to strengthen their bonds. Baboon young are raised in small family groups, being instructed by multiple adults at a time. A truly fascinating community and unique to our animal kingdom, baboons should be given a wide berth and travelers should cautiously handle an unexpected meeting by a local troop should your paths cross.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Thinking myself a rather clever sleuth in finding some ill-witted bandit’s secret treasures, I did quickly reach my hand within the tunnel only to be greeted by something oddly fuzzy and a most severe pain to boot! Let my incident (and missing finger) with the woodland badger be warning to those lacking in wisdom; do not reach into places where your hand does not belong!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Merchant Lord Ellemond Doughty.</p>\n<p>The common forest dwelling badger is a creature of ingenuity and sheer determination. This creature, resembling a most rotund and powerful weasel, busies itself upon the forest floor catching its prey of insects and small mammals all the while toiling away at creating itself a sett, or more commonly called, a burrow. The badger’s coat is decked in marvelous black and white stripes running the length of its body. With gentle eyes and an otherwise calm demeanor, the badger exudes an image of a more timid beast; however, this outer appearance should be observed with caution. Armed with thick, elongated claws made for churning through the toughest of soil and a set of powerful jaws to match, badgers are quick to defend themselves should a foolish soul harass them. As long as you do not agitate the badger, it will find no recourse to harm you.</p>\n<p><strong>Miraculous Mandibles.</strong> A badger’s most intriguing feature is a set of peculiar jawbones with provide it with a spectacular method of defense. The animal’s jaws are set into long cavities within its skull allowing the badger to lock its jaws in place thus increasing its already powerful bite strength and avoid the possibility of mandible dislocation. A truly remarkable evolutionary advantage in avoiding combat (rather than confronting its adversary) is the badger’s natural odor. These creatures can release a powerful musk from scent glands located near their rears which can easily drive away predators. It is for these reasons that many forest dwelling cultures revere the badger as a guardian of the forest and attempt to utilize the badger’s unique abilities in their own bid for survival in the wilds of our world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes.

Camels have been domesticated for millennia. Highly sought after for their ability to survive within the harshest of deserts, the earliest records of camels in our world show them as domestic pack animals (much as they are utilized today) carrying heavy cargo across sandy expanses of inhospitable desert. The noble camel, however, may hold more secrets than its surface reveals.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch Out, They Spit.</strong> When asking a commoner about the camel’s most unique feature they will undoubtedly tell you that it is the fleshy humps upon the camel’s tall back. Commonly, these humps were thought to hold a reservoir of fresh water so the camel may survive the sandy dunes of its homeland; this is, however, not the case at all. Dissection of the dromedary beast has shown researchers that these humps are actually composed of fatty tissue which have collected into the humps as to not overheat the beast by being spread across the body. Camels, in fact, need only drink once every ten-day as their insulated coat keeps them at an adequate temperature and they absorb sufficient water vapor through exhaling via the nostrils. Camels also have a leathery mouth-lining allowing the herbivores to chew and swallow even the thorniest of cacti should they require water in such a fashion. Should you be in the desert and in need of a sturdy beast, adventurer, why not invest your gold into the camel? Just be mindful, they enjoy spitting on those they do not trust!</p>"

Found in a number of varieties from the pure black short-haired cats associated with ill omens to the fluffy coated and absurdly flat-faced cats of the frozen north, there appears to be limitless breeds to select from. (Author’s Note: I have recently heard rumor of a cat which produces no hair, requiring its master to simply stroke its flesh without pleasant barriers. More evidence forthcoming of this unfounded discovery). However, our feline compatriots have much more to offer when looked at under the shrewd eye of the adventurer!</p>\n<p><strong>Purrfect Pals.</strong> Be it at the side of the elder potion-maker tucked safely away in their shop or out with the upstart young ranger braving the rolling fields of the hinterlands, cats are found dotted all across our marvelous land. Compact and light in weight, these agile little hunters fit perfectly atop one’s shoulder or nestled within a wagon’s goods. Cats provide useful utility to the crafty conjurer who binds their familiar to such a form as well; with honed claws able to retract in a lighting’s flash back into their paws the cat makes for a deadly hunter against smaller beasts. Cats also have a flexible spine allowing them to squeeze into difficult to reach places should you coax them adequately or even survive a perilous fall. Researchers have discovered that cats seem to have the uncanny ability to land upon their feet regardless of the angle at which they are dropped; surely this is an astonishing advantage over other less agile creatures! Deathly quiet (unless they prefer to pester their master for tasty morsels with a noisome yowl) a cat is an adequate infiltrator should one prefer to observe their surroundings from a safer distance through this familiar’s eyes.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human’s hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab’s ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar’s eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Deer present with noticeable sexual dimorphism; the males or “bucks” brandish large multi-pronged racks of antlers upon their heads which they shed and regrow annually. Female deer, or “does”, lack the antlers of their male counterparts but are no less hardy when it comes to defending their herds.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Deer, oh Deer</strong>. Deer are commonly docile creatures who will often flee at the first sight of any humanoid wandering into their domain. However, should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a buck during their mating season, you should consider taking a different path. Male deer’s antlers can easily pierce weaker armor and flesh, tearing through a body as easily as a spear. Should you walk too close to a doe’s precious children (or fawns) you will most assuredly experience the taste of the mother’s hardened hooves upon you packing an uncanny amount of force for such nimble frames. Deer, when an adventurer’s survival is considered, are best hunted from a distance to avoid these vicious melee defenses. The deer’s meat, called “venison”, is mildly gamey though tasty and filling all the same, and the beasts’ hides can be used for warmth or shelter in times of great need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

It is with these powerful wings and their keen vision that an eagle can surprise its prey from soaring heights, giving the avian the element of surprise on unsuspecting prey.

The birds nest in homemade eyries, or nests, high above the world on mountain cliff faces. Here in the eyrie, the eagles lay their clutch of two eggs and raise a tiny, insular family with the female (and often much larger) chick taking dominance over any male born into the clan. The chicks grow under the care of their parents, being fed on a diet of regurgitated food until they are large enough to learn how to fly on their own. At this point, baby eagles are shunned from the nest and forced out into the world to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Lone Ranger.</strong> Eagles make fine companions for those who understand that these birds of prey are no mere pet, but an equal ally in their adventurers. Rangers seem particularly fond of the eagle as a hunting partner, as the birds may roam far and wide during a hunt and bring their master back any spoils they’ve found on their quest. This specialized form of modern falconry utilizes the eagles as trackers as well, as the eagle may spot prey from a great distance, then return to their master and guide them towards the quarry. Should you be adventuring out into the world and have the patience for such a companion, perhaps consider the eagle as a recommended choice for seasoned hunters.</p>"

Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Though giant in only the relative sense to their non-illuminated cousins, the Giant Fire Beetle typically spans the width of an adult human’s hand. These tiny, docile titans content themselves in scuttling through darkened places such as caverns, catacombs, and mossy overgrowths in search of scraps to eat or a quiet, damp place in which to make their burrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Of Darkness and Light.</strong> Curiously enough, due to the species evolving without the natural light of our sun, the poor creature is completely blind. The Giant Fire Beetle, however, is not totally without senses. Using specialized antenna, these hardy insects are able to “see” the world around them within a slightly limited ranged. The true prize (as so many fledgling adventurers boast) is the orange bioluminescent glands located beneath either side of their mandibles and to the very rear of their abdomen. These firey hued glands are packed with a symbiotic, glowing fungus, which will continue to glow for up to one week once disconnected from their host! Some clever adventurers have taken to capturing live beetles, placing them within empty lanterns to light their way in remote caverns for even longer periods of time.</p>\n<p><strong>In Last Resort.</strong> Most often a peaceful insect, Giant Fire Beetles have been observed defending food in times of great hunger; the creatures will rarely flee a tasty morsel should they feel a threat to their meal is near. The Giant Fire Beetle does pack a nasty bite with its sharpened mandibles that may pierce even the toughest boiled leather armor should it feel threatened enough to attack. Take heed when approaching a swarm of these insects lest you suffer some nasty lacerations. Older texts on the nature of beasts do speak of a breed of Giant Fire Beetle that excreted a combustible fluid and ignited the mixture causing severe burns to the unwary. This has never been scientifically proven, but new discoveries happen each day!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.

A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.

However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls.

Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon.

The homunculi have the extraordinary ability to experience the thoughts and senses of their master as the two share a special telepathic bond that may only be broken in death of if one of the parties ventures to a separate plane of existence. The homunculus is also gifted a language upon awakening and may act as a servant, spy, or even simple messenger for their master. It is not at all uncommon to see those in possession of a homunculus to utilize them in completing simple chores about their abodes so the spellcaster may focus on more tedious tasks. An odd caveat of this homunculus ritual is that the spellcaster may only be in possession of one clay companion at a time; should the caster attempt to create a new homunculus the process with always fail. Unless the creature or spellcaster dies, it will remain at the caster’s side as a loyal companion for the whole of their life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

These chittering “laughs” have given the hyena (regardless of species to commoners) the moniker of The Laughing Hyena. One should instead feel caution over joy should you hear the caterwauling yips of a hyena pack in the distance. These beasts are highly intelligent and when banded together and utilizing their preferred hunting patterns they may easily overtake a large mercantile caravan.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hungering Savagery.</strong> The hyena’s most sinister aspect is their relation to the Demon Lord of the Gnolls, Yeenoghu. Gnolls, of course, resemble massive humanoid hyenas brandishing bloody weapons and sowing destruction in their horrid wakes. Finding the hyena either useful or ironic, Gnolls will bring packs of slavering hyenas with them on raids into villages or leave the beasts (which they purposefully starve) at their dens to kill any unwary explorers. Adventurers should be observant when investigating the happenings of hyenas in an area, as if the beasts seem more ravenous than expected it may be that Yeenoghu’s minions are not far behind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Jackals have a unique social structure among canids as they most often shirk life with a pack in favor of finding a singular, monogamous mate with whom they remain in a wide territory. This is not to say that some jackals do not form packs; however, it will be more common in your travels to spot a bachelor or breeding pair rather than a whole cluster of these beasts. Much like the savannah’s hyenas, the jackal does not escape the skeptical eye of the trained adventurer as the warning sign of evil upon the horizon.

Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

The Merfolk themselves, however, choose neither to confirm or deny this tale. Very basically, Merfolk resemble an average humanoid with a few key differences. Where one would expect to find legs beneath the torso of a human, they would instead find the powerful tail of a relatively sized fish. Merfolk also have frilled gills adorning their necks allowing them to breathe the salty waters of the ocean's depths. Several additional fins grace the Merfolk's lithe body about the biceps and hips. Upon the Merfolk's humanoid head rests a single, large frill webbed by translucent skin which may raise or fold back depending on the Merfolk's mood.</p>\n<p><strong>Murmaider.</strong> Merfolk live along the coastal waters of continental shelves, rarely allowing themselves to drift down into the darker depths of the ocean's abyss. Here in the more shallow tides, the Merfolk build their homes into thriving coral reefs, labyrinthian undersea caverns, and even the hollowed out remains of once coastal cities or sunken vessels. Anywhere shrouded from the view of prying land-dwellers makes the perfect home for a Merfolk. The Merfolk's reclusiveness is so well known, that mariners would tell fanciful tales of meeting a Merfolk for a midnight tryst, only to be abandoned at sunrise by the elusive creature. Most of the mariner's fellows would shove the notion aside, having never seen a living or dead Merfolk in all their years at sea. This is not to say that Merfolk will flee from intruders should an unfortunate landlubber find their way into a Merfolk's abode. Armed with spears of sharpened coral and powerful webbed hands ending in dagger-like barbs the Merfolk are well equipped to defend themselves within their aquatic homes. Take care on the open seas, adventurer, and never run afoul of the Merfolk.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article. Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils. While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat. The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Tread on Me.</strong> Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings. Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance. While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them. Snakes \"smell\" with their tongues! Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues. Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs. Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight. The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs. Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins. While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles. Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

No one has yet volunteered to sacrifice their beast to the swarm to test this boast to date.<br><em>- A note on my studies in the Underdark.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Quipper is a variety of carnivorous fish found in almost any body of water regardless of location. Approximately the size of an adult human’s fist, these tiny beasts are ravenous when they sense any scrap of food is nearby. The quipper’s jaw is lined with a jagged row of dagger-sharp teeth which they use to strip flesh from bones at lightning speed. The quipper’s ability to see even within the darkness of a frigid cavern lake makes them extremely deadly to the unwary traveler who takes an accidental plunge into the darkened waters. Though it is not entirely unheard of to see quippers on their own it is far more common that they travel in swirling swarms. These clouds of razor-toothed fish can sense blood in the water from great distances, able to sniff a single drop of the life giving fluid in over 200 liters of water. I suggest that any adventurer steer well clear of any water they are not certain is free of quippers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.

A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself. Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur. Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth. Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

			"description": "<p>Vultures are some of the most reviled birds to travel our skies. The bird’s bald, featherless head and black body plumage lend it a sinister facade. The vulture’s outer appearance along with its penchant to scavenge carrion for sustenance has settled the bird squarely into the designation of “evil” in the eyes of many common-folk. The bird’s connection with death, as the vulture will circle a dead or dying creature from high above, also adds to the revulsion felt towards this markedly important creature.</p>\n<p><strong>By Committee.</strong> Vultures congregate in groups called “committees” or “wakes” on whether or not they are feasting together respectively. These groups squabble for scraps of meat, ripping away rotting flesh from a carcass with their sharp and powerful beaks. It is not uncommon for fights to break out between the hungry birds. Due to their desire to scavenge dead flesh, vultures play a vital role in our ecosystem, as they act as vital decomposers in landscapes where insects or fungi may not exist as readily. Be on the lookout for vultures in your travels, as they can be the sign of nature at work or perhaps something more sinister beneath the talons of this bird.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel’s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent’s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite. Keep your curious fingers out of any small rodent burrows you find, lest you end up provoking a weasel during his well-earned meal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>"
